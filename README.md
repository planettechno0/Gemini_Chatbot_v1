Of course! A good README is essential for any application. Here is a comprehensive README file for the advanced Gemini chatbot we've built. It covers the features, setup, usage, and technical details.

You can save this content as a README.md file in the same directory as your chatbot's HTML file.

Advanced Single-File Gemini Chatbot
A feature-rich, single-file web application that provides a powerful, ChatGPT-like chat interface for Google's Gemini models. This entire application runs from a single .html file with no need for a backend server or complex build steps.

It's designed to be portable, easy to set up, and packed with advanced features for a robust user experience.

‚ú® Features
This chatbot goes beyond simple message-and-response, incorporating many features found in modern AI chat applications:

Multi-Turn Conversations: Remembers the context of the current conversation to provide coherent follow-up responses.
Image Attachments (Multimodal): Attach images to your prompts to leverage the power of multimodal models like Gemini 1.5 Pro.
Custom Instructions: Set a custom "system prompt" in the settings to guide the AI's personality, tone, and response format throughout the conversation.
Persistent Sessions: Your current chat conversation is automatically saved to your browser's localStorage and restored when you reopen the app.
Chat Archiving: Option to "Save & New," which archives your current chat before starting a new one.
Message Editing: Edit your previous prompts. The chatbot will then regenerate the conversation from that point forward.
Regenerate Responses: Not satisfied with the AI's last answer? Click the regenerate button to get a new response.
Markdown Rendering: The AI's responses are rendered with support for bold, italics, inline code, and multi-line code blocks.
Copy to Clipboard: Easily copy any of the AI's responses with a single click.
Model Selection: Choose from a list of powerful Gemini and Gemma models to suit your needs.
Built-in Debugger: A "Logs" window shows all console output and includes a test runner to check API connectivity and other core functions.
Fully Self-Contained: Everything is in a single HTML file. No dependencies, no build process, no server required.
Responsive Design: A clean, mobile-first interface that works great on any screen size.
üöÄ Getting Started
Getting the chatbot up and running is incredibly simple.

Prerequisites
You need a Google Gemini API Key. You can get one for free from:

Google AI Studio
Setup
Save the Code: Save the provided application code as an index.html file on your computer.
Open the File: Double-click the index.html file to open it in any modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).
Enter API Key: The first time you open the app, a "Settings" modal will pop up.
Paste your Gemini API Key into the designated field.
Click "Save Settings".
That's it! The application is ready to use. Your API key will be saved in your browser's localStorage for future sessions.

üîß How to Use
Sending Messages: Type your message in the input box at the bottom and press "Send" or hit Enter.
Attaching Images: Click the image icon to the left of the input box to select an image file. A preview will appear. You can then add a text prompt or send the image by itself.
Editing Your Message: Hover over a message you've sent and click the edit icon (pencil). The conversation will be regenerated from your edited prompt.
Copying & Regenerating: Hover over a response from the AI to see the copy and regenerate icons.
Starting a New Chat: Click the "New Chat" icon (+) in the header. You will be prompted with two options:
Clear & New: Discards the current chat and starts a fresh one.
Save & New: Saves your current chat to an "archive" in your browser's storage and then starts a fresh one.
Changing Settings: Click the "Settings" icon (gear) in the header at any time to change your API Key, select a different model, or add/edit your Custom Instructions.
Viewing Logs: In the Settings modal, click "View Logs & Test" to open the debugging window. You can see detailed application logs, run basic tests, and copy the log data.
‚öôÔ∏è Technical Details
Stack:
HTML5: For the core structure.
Tailwind CSS: For styling, pulled directly from a CDN.
Modern JavaScript (ESM): All application logic is contained within a <script type="module"> tag inside the HTML file. It is written to be clean and modular without requiring any build tools.
State Management:
localStorage is used to persist application state across browser sessions.
geminiAdvancedChatState: Stores the currently active chat session (including the conversation array, API key, model, and custom instructions).
geminiArchivedChats: Stores an array of saved chat sessions when you use the "Save & New" feature.
‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations
No UI for Archived Chats: While the "Save & New" feature archives chats to localStorage, this version does not include a sidebar or UI to view, manage, or load these archived chats. This is a potential area for future development.
No Response Streaming: The AI's response appears all at once after it has been fully generated, not token-by-token. Implementing streaming would require using the streamGenerateContent API endpoint.
Image Size: The application does not pre-process images. Very large images may exceed the API's request size limits and cause errors.
Browser-Only: As a completely client-side application, all data (including your API key and saved chats) is stored in your browser.
